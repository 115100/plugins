## Notes

All scripts are under the [MIT license](/license).

### Lua

Any lua scripts will require the plugin which is included with HexChat 2.12.1+. These are recommended
over the Python versions as they typically have the same functionality but are far lighter on memory
and more portable.

### Python

Most of the Python scripts will work in Python 2.7 or 3.3+ on Windows or Linux and many require HexChat 2.9.6+
as a lot was changed in that release.

### JavaScript

Any javascript scripts will require the plugin I wrote that can be found [here](https://github.com/TingPing/hexchat-javascript).
